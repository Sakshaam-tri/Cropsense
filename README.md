This project is a smart agriculture decision-support system that predicts the top 3 most profitable crops to grow based on a farmer’s state, district, and selected month. It combines historical agricultural data, mandi market price trends, real-time weather conditions, and environmental risk assessment to provide reliable crop planning guidance.
